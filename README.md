This is a report of the analysis of the health indicators associated with diabetes collected by a health-related telephone survey of over 200,000 individuals.

# Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose.
After different foods are broken down into sugars during digestion, the sugars are then released into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps enable cells within the body to use those sugars in the bloodstream for energy. Diabetes is generally characterized by either the body not making enough insulin or being unable to use the insulin that is made as effectively as needed.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths.
While there is no cure for diabetes, early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment. In this project, I analyzed diabetes health-related telephone survey collected by The Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from over 200,000  Americans.
# Problem Statement
From the dataset, I would analyze the factors that contribute to risk of having diabetes and how lifestyle influences this risk. 
# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was gotten from www.kaggle.com 
# Attributes of the data
The following are what each field in the dataset means:
_Diabetes - 0 = no diabetes 1 = prediabetes 2 = diabetes
_High Blood Pressure - 0 = no high blood pressure 1 = high blood pressure
_High Cholesterol - 0 = no high cholesterol 1 = high cholesterol
_Cholesterol Check - 0 = no cholesterol check in 5 years 1 = yes cholesterol check in 5 years
